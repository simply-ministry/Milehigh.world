# Security Policy

This document outlines the security measures and policies for the "Milehigh.World: Into the Void" project.

## Core Security Principle: Server-Authoritative Architecture

The primary security measure for the game is a **server-authoritative architecture**. This means that the game server is the ultimate source of truth for all game state and logic. Client applications are treated as untrusted and are only responsible for sending user input to the server and rendering the game state received from the server.

This approach prevents a wide range of cheating and exploits, including:
-   **Modified game clients:** Changes to the client code to grant unfair advantages (e.g., god mode, speed hacks) will be ineffective as the server validates all actions.
-   **Packet manipulation:** Attempts to modify network traffic to alter game outcomes will be rejected by the server.
-   **State manipulation:** The server maintains the canonical game state, preventing clients from directly modifying their health, inventory, or position.

The recent refactoring of the combat system (`IngrisZayaEncounter.cs` and `ServerCombatManager.cs`) is a concrete example of this principle in action. All hit detection, damage calculation, and cooldowns are now managed authoritatively by the server.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate the community's efforts to help us keep our game secure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us by emailing `security@milehigh.world`.

Please include the following information in your report:
-   A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
-   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
-   Any relevant screenshots, videos, or code snippets.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will work to address the vulnerability in a timely manner.

## Other Security Measures

In addition to the server-authoritative architecture, we are committed to implementing the following security best practices:

### Secure Communication
All communication between the game client and the server will be encrypted using industry-standard protocols such as TLS 1.3 to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Data Encryption
Sensitive player data, both at rest and in transit, will be encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.

### Anti-Cheat Mechanisms
We will integrate third-party anti-cheat solutions and develop our own proprietary systems to detect and prevent cheating. This includes measures to identify bots, automation tools, and other unauthorized software.

### Input Validation
The server will perform rigorous validation of all client inputs to ensure they are within expected parameters, preventing exploits such as buffer overflows or injection attacks.
