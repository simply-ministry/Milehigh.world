An Analytical Deep Dive into the Combat Architectures of Sword Art Online, Kingdom Hearts, and Final Fantasy VII Remake
Introduction
The modern Japanese Role-Playing Game (JRPG) genre is a landscape of diverse and evolving design philosophies, particularly within the domain of combat systems. Moving beyond the turn-based paradigms that once defined the genre, developers have increasingly embraced real-time action, leading to a proliferation of hybrid systems that seek to balance visceral engagement with strategic depth. This report will conduct an exhaustive comparative analysis of the combat architectures of three seminal franchises that exemplify distinct evolutionary branches of this trend: Sword Art Online, the Kingdom Hearts saga, and Final Fantasy VII Remake.
These franchises are not merely collections of features but are representative of comprehensive design philosophies that reflect their unique narrative premises, player expectations, and development histories. Sword Art Online presents the unique challenge of translating a fictional, lore-based Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) into tangible, playable video game mechanics. The Kingdom Hearts series offers a longitudinal study in mechanical evolution, with each installment's combat system reflecting the protagonist's growth, the narrative's tone, and the constraints of its host hardware. Final Fantasy VII Remake stands as a masterclass in modernization, meticulously constructing a hybrid system that preserves the strategic, menu-based soul of its 1997 predecessor within a contemporary action framework.
This analysis will provide a granular deconstruction of each franchise's core systems, followed by a holistic comparative analysis. By dissecting not just what these systems are, but why they are designed as they are and how they function to create a cohesive player experience, this report aims to illuminate the intricate art and science behind modern JRPG combat design.
I. Sword Art Online: The Duality of Fictional Systems and Real Gameplay
The Sword Art Online franchise presents a unique analytical challenge: it requires a dual-layered examination of both the fictional, in-universe mechanics of its central VRMMORPG and the subsequent translation of those concepts into tangible gameplay across a series of licensed video games. The core design imperative is to bridge the gap between a narrative about an immersive, high-stakes virtual world and the practical realities of a player holding a controller.
1.1 The Aincrad Paradigm: Designing a "Death Game"
The foundation of Sword Art Online's combat is the set of rules established for the fictional VRMMORPG set within the floating castle of Aincrad. These mechanics are designed not just for gameplay balance but to serve a narrative built on tension, survival, and the psychological toll of a high-stakes environment.
Player Stats and Progression
The character progression system in the Aincrad game is built upon a familiar RPG framework. Players have four primary stats: Strength (STR), Agility (AGI), Vitality (VIT), and Stamina. These stats govern typical combat attributes, with STR also determining a player's inventory weight capacity, a crucial factor for long expeditions. Progression is achieved through a standard leveling system fueled by experience points gained from defeating monsters and completing quests. However, a key distinction is the acquisition of Skill Slots. Players begin with two slots and gain additional ones at specific level milestones—level 6, 12, 20, and every 10 levels thereafter—creating a system where leveling up directly expands a player's tactical versatility.
Sword Skills and Weapon Proficiency
The most defining characteristic of Aincrad's combat is its complete lack of a magic system, a deliberate design choice that forces an exclusive focus on melee combat through "Sword Skills". These are not player-created moves but system-assisted abilities that are activated when a player performs a specific, predetermined physical pose. The NerveGear technology interprets the player's brain signals for movement and translates the correct pose into a high-speed, powerful attack that would be impossible to execute through manual control alone.
Crucially, new Sword Skills are not unlocked by a character's overall level. Instead, they are tied to a separate "proficiency" statistic for each weapon type, which increases only through the repeated use of that weapon. This creates a dual-progression system: a player's level dictates their raw stats and number of available skill slots, but their weapon proficiency dictates the quality and variety of the skills they can equip. This design encourages specialization and rewards dedication to a particular fighting style.
The Permadeath Imperative
The central mechanic that elevates Aincrad from a simple game to a narrative crucible is the "death game" rule: if a player's in-game HP reaches zero, or if their NerveGear helmet is forcibly removed, a microwave pulse from the device destroys their brain, resulting in real-world death. This single rule fundamentally recontextualizes every other game mechanic.
Standard MMORPG risks become life-or-death decisions, forcing a dramatic shift in player psychology and strategy. Cautious tactics become paramount, such as the player-coined strategy of "50%ing," which involves immediately disengaging from combat and using a teleport crystal the moment one's HP drops below 50%. Items like teleport crystals, typically a convenience, become essential, life-saving tools whose high cost reflects their value. The psychological pressure is immense; the narrative establishes that in the first month alone, 2,000 players died, with many succumbing to despair and suicide rather than combat. This permadeath system is the ultimate game mechanic, transforming every monster encounter, every resource management choice, and every social interaction into a matter of survival.
1.2 From NerveGear to Gamepad: The Challenge of Adaptation
The various Sword Art Online video games face the difficult task of translating the immersive, high-stakes experience of the fictional VRMMORPG into an engaging experience on traditional gaming platforms. This has led to an evolution in design, with each major title offering a different interpretation of the source material's core concepts.
Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment
This title most closely attempts to simulate the feel of an MMO. Combat is built around a real-time system featuring auto-attacks when stationary, with player actions focused on managing a Skill Points (SP) bar for abilities and a "Burst" gauge for executing more powerful, timed attacks. The game introduces a "Risk" system, a gauge that increases as the player performs aggressive actions. A high Risk level makes the player more vulnerable to damage and slows resource regeneration. This mechanic serves as a direct gameplay analogue for the psychological pressure of the death game; while the player's real life is not at stake, entering a high-risk state in-game creates a period of intense vulnerability that must be carefully managed, mirroring the fear of making a fatal error in Aincrad.
Furthermore, Hollow Fragment places a heavy emphasis on the partner character. The player must actively manage aggro, issue commands for specific actions, and use a "praise" mechanic to restore the partner's SP and encourage certain behaviors. This design reinforces the themes of cooperation and trust that are central to the Aincrad arc's narrative, where solo play is depicted as exceptionally dangerous.
Sword Art Online: Lost Song
Lost Song represents a significant mechanical departure, shifting focus from the Aincrad setting to the flight-based world of ALfheim Online. The combat moves away from the MMO simulation towards a more direct action hack-and-slash system. The core loop involves a combination of weak and strong attacks, dodges, blocks, and a skill menu for special abilities, with combat seamlessly transitioning between ground and aerial states. The flight mechanic, with its distinct "Float" (vertical movement) and "Flight" (forward movement) modes, becomes the game's central feature. While this provides a unique sense of freedom, it also introduces new design challenges, particularly with the camera and lock-on system, making it difficult to target specific parts on large, mobile enemies.
Sword Art Online: Alicization Lycoris
This installment returns to a more tactical, ground-based combat system that is arguably the most complex in the series. The core combat loop revolves around managing enemy states. The primary objective is to build an enemy's "Hazard" gauge, which puts them into a vulnerable state. Once hazarded, players can use specific skills to "Launch" the enemy into the air and then bring them down into a "Downed" state, opening a window for massive damage.
This system is inextricably linked to the "Chain Burst" mechanic. To deal effective damage, especially against bosses with enormous health pools, players must command their AI party members to use their own Sword Skills in rapid succession after the player initiates an attack. A successful chain builds a damage multiplier, making party management and precise command timing the paramount skills. This design explicitly mechanizes the coordinated, raid-style teamwork that the front-line players in the Aincrad narrative had to master to defeat floor bosses.
1.3 The Mechanical Translation of Narrative Themes
A close examination of the Sword Art Online games reveals a consistent design trend: rather than attempting a literal simulation of a VRMMORPG, the developers have focused on creating mechanical analogues for the narrative's core themes. The existential threat of permadeath is too abstract to replicate directly, so it is translated into systems that create tangible in-game pressure. In Hollow Fragment, the Risk system makes the player mechanically vulnerable when they are reckless, forcing a cautious playstyle that echoes the survivalist mindset of the Aincrad players. In Alicization Lycoris, the immense health of enemies and the critical importance of the Chain Burst system translate the theme of cooperation into a hard requirement for success. A single player is intentionally made ineffective, forcing reliance on the party and mechanizing the idea that survival in Aincrad depends on trust and teamwork.
This approach also redefines what "skill" means in the context of the game. In the Aincrad lore, skill is a blend of system knowledge and the player's own physical reflexes, as translated by the NerveGear. The video games must reinterpret this for a controller-based experience. Hollow Fragment defines skill as tactical resource management—juggling SP, Burst, and Risk while effectively commanding a partner. Lost Song shifts the definition to mastery of its complex 3D flight and aerial combat controls. Alicization Lycoris defines skill as high-level tactical awareness: the ability to read enemy states, manage party-wide resources, and execute complex, timed Chain Bursts under pressure. This evolution shows a clear design trajectory away from simulating the power of a single prodigy and towards mechanizing the cooperative strategies essential to the group's survival.
II. The Kingdom Hearts Saga: A Chronicle of Mechanical Evolution
The Kingdom Hearts series is a case study in continuous, and at times radical, mechanical iteration. Its combat system has never remained static, with each major installment introducing new paradigms or significantly refining existing ones. This evolution is not arbitrary; it is a direct reflection of the series' narrative progression, the hardware capabilities of the platforms it appears on, and, most importantly, the developmental arc of its protagonist, Sora.
2.1 The Foundational Formula (Kingdom Hearts I & II)
The early PlayStation 2 titles established the core identity of Kingdom Hearts combat while also showcasing a dramatic leap in design and feel between the first and second games.
Kingdom Hearts I
Released in 2002, the original Kingdom Hearts was a significant departure from developer Square's turn-based RPG tradition, introducing a novel blend of real-time action and menu-based commands. The system established the series' fundamentals: a third-person perspective with free movement, a three-hit melee combo, and a command menu in the bottom-left corner for accessing magic, items, and summons. However, by modern standards, the combat is often described as "clunky" and "slow". Sora's animations are heavy and committal, making it difficult to cancel out of an action, and his aerial combat capabilities are extremely limited. This perceived clunkiness, however, serves a distinct narrative purpose. It reflects the 14-year-old Sora's status as an untrained, accidental hero. His wide, powerful swings are those of a boy fighting with raw determination rather than refined skill, and the game's mechanics effectively communicate his inexperience.
Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories
As a title developed for the Game Boy Advance, Chain of Memories required a complete mechanical overhaul. The result was the series' first major deviation: a real-time, card-based combat system. In this system, every action—from attacking to casting spells—is tied to a card in a player-built deck. Battles unfold in real-time arenas, but actions are governed by a "card break" system: playing a card with a higher numerical value than an opponent's cancels their action. The "Sleight" mechanic adds another layer of strategy, allowing players to stock and unleash three cards at once for a powerful, unbreakable attack. The trade-off is that the first card in the Sleight is lost for the rest of the battle, introducing a critical element of resource management and strategic deck-building.
Kingdom Hearts II
This sequel represents a monumental refinement of the first game's formula, creating a system that is still lauded as a high point in the action RPG genre. Sora's movement is now exceptionally fast, fluid, and acrobatic, a direct reflection of his growth as a hero over the previous year. The combat is enhanced by two transformative new systems:
 * Reaction Commands: These are context-sensitive actions triggered by pressing the Triangle button at key moments during battle. They allow for spectacular, cinematic counters, finishers, and interactions with bosses, making combat more dynamic and rewarding player observation and timing.
 * Drive Forms: This system allows Sora to expend a "Drive Gauge" to transform into powerful new forms, such as the dual-wielding, melee-focused Valor Form or the magic-centric Wisdom Form. Each form alters Sora's abilities, enhances his stats, and often grants advanced movement options. This adds a significant layer of tactical choice, as activating a form requires temporarily sacrificing a party member and managing a finite resource.
2.2 The Command Deck Revolution (Birth by Sleep & Dream Drop Distance)
The series' handheld entries on the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo 3DS introduced another major paradigm shift, moving away from the traditional command menu in favor of a more customizable and fast-paced system.
Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep
Developed for the PSP, Birth by Sleep introduced the "Command Deck". This system replaces the static command menu with a customizable deck of abilities, spells, and items that the player curates outside of battle. In combat, the player cycles through this deck and executes commands in real-time, after which the used command enters a cooldown period before it can be used again. This design encourages a more proactive and varied playstyle, breaking away from the melee-combo-centric rhythm of Kingdom Hearts II and giving magic and special abilities equal prominence.
Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance
Building directly upon the Command Deck foundation, this 3DS title introduced "Flowmotion," a highly kinetic and liberating movement system. Flowmotion allows players to interact with walls, poles, and other environmental objects to launch into acrobatic dashes, grinds, and powerful attacks. This mechanic fundamentally altered the feel of both combat and exploration, turning the environment from a static backdrop into an active tool for offense and traversal.
2.3 The Grand Synthesis (Kingdom Hearts III)
The combat system of Kingdom Hearts III is intentionally designed as a grand synthesis of the series' entire mechanical history, combining the refined foundation of Kingdom Hearts II with key concepts from the handheld titles.
 * Keyblade Transformations: This system is a direct evolution of KH2's Drive Forms. Instead of Sora himself transforming, landing successful combos fills a gauge that allows his currently equipped Keyblade to transform into a completely different weapon type, such as a giant hammer, dual yo-yos, or even a rocket launcher. Each transformation comes with a unique moveset, effectively allowing the player to switch combat styles on the fly.
 * Situation Commands: An evolution of Reaction Commands, Situation Commands provide access to the most powerful abilities in the game. As the player performs certain actions—such as landing a long combo, exploiting an elemental weakness, or healing allies—contextual commands will appear above the menu. These commands can trigger Keyblade Transformations, powerful "Grand Magic" spells, or spectacular team-up attacks with party members.
 * Attraction Flow: These are large-scale, cinematic special attacks based on iconic Disney theme park rides, like the Mad Tea Cups or the Pirate Ship. They function as screen-clearing "super" moves that can be activated through Situation Commands. While visually impressive, they have been a point of criticism for being overly frequent and for temporarily removing direct player control from the battle.
2.4 Mechanics as Narrative and Design Tension
The mechanical evolution across the Kingdom Hearts saga is a powerful example of gameplay serving as an extension of narrative. Sora's combat capabilities are a direct mirror of his character arc. He begins in KH1 as a clumsy but determined boy, and his controls reflect this. By KH2, he is a fluid and confident hero, and his expanded, acrobatic moveset communicates this newfound mastery. The Command Deck used by the protagonists of Birth by Sleep feels more formal and structured, befitting their status as trained Keyblade wielders, in stark contrast to Sora's self-taught style. Flowmotion in Dream Drop Distance is explicitly tied to the game's "dream world" setting, where the laws of physics are pliable. Finally, the sheer spectacle and power of the systems in KH3 represent Sora at the apex of his abilities, a true Keyblade Master.
This evolution also highlights a core design tension within the series: the balance between accessibility and depth. Systems like Reaction Commands and Attraction Flow are designed to be simple to execute (often requiring a single button press) and highly rewarding visually, ensuring that a player of all skill levels can experience spectacular moments. This has led to recurring criticism that the games can be "button mashy" or that they "press triangle to win". To counteract this, the developers consistently implement deeper, often hidden, mechanics for advanced players. A prime example is the "Revenge Value" system in Kingdom Hearts II, a hidden counter on bosses that prevents them from being infinitely combo-locked, forcing high-level players to learn precise combo lengths and enemy attack patterns. Similarly, the game's higher difficulty settings, like Critical Mode, drastically alter enemy behavior and damage values, forcing players to engage with the full breadth of the combat system—including guards, dodges, invincibility frames, and resource management—to survive. This reveals a consistent dual-audience design philosophy: a visually impressive and accessible layer for a broad audience, underpinned by a complex and technical layer for dedicated fans seeking a deeper challenge.
III. Final Fantasy VII Remake: The Modern Hybrid of Action and Strategy
The combat system of Final Fantasy VII Remake is a masterwork of modern JRPG design, representing a deliberate and highly successful effort to translate the strategic, turn-based combat of the 1997 original into a framework that meets the expectations of a contemporary, action-oriented audience. It achieves this not by simply layering menus over a hack-and-slash game, but by creating a deeply symbiotic relationship between real-time action and turn-based strategy.
3.1 The Symbiotic Loop: Action Feeds Strategy
The system is fundamentally a hybrid that fuses two distinct but interconnected modes of play into a seamless loop.
 * The Hybrid Model: The foundation is the Action Mode, where the player has direct, real-time control over a character. This includes basic attacks (Square button), a unique character-specific ability (Triangle button), blocking (R1), and dodging (Circle). However, the primary purpose of this Action Mode is not to deal significant damage. Instead, these actions are the main method for charging the Active Time Battle (ATB) gauge.
 * The ATB System: The ATB gauge, a staple of the classic Final Fantasy series, is reimagined here. It consists of two bars that fill over time but fill much faster when the player successfully lands attacks, blocks, or parries. Once one bar is full, the player can enter Tactical Mode by pressing the X button. This slows time to a near-stop, allowing the player to strategically select powerful Abilities, Spells, or Items from a command menu, each of which costs one or two ATB bars to execute. This design creates the core gameplay loop: proficiency in real-time action directly generates the resources required for impactful, strategic decisions.
 * Party Management: The player can freely switch between the three active party members at any time. This is not merely an option but a core strategic necessity. The game's AI is designed to heavily prioritize targeting the character currently under player control. This encourages, and at higher difficulties demands, frequent character switching. By swapping characters, the player can effectively manage enemy aggression, draw an enemy's attention away from a vulnerable ally, build ATB on characters who are not being targeted, and position the entire party for optimal spell or ability usage.
3.2 The Art of the Stagger: A Multi-Stage Offensive
The single most important strategic pillar of Final Fantasy VII Remake's combat is the Stagger mechanic. It transforms every significant encounter from a simple war of attrition into a multi-stage tactical puzzle, providing a clear objective that guides player strategy.
 * Phase 1: Applying Pressure: The first step to staggering an enemy is to put them in a "Pressured" state. This is a period of vulnerability, indicated by text under the enemy's health bar, during which their Stagger gauge fills much more rapidly. An enemy is typically pressured by exploiting its weaknesses, which can be discovered using the Assess materia. This often involves hitting it with a specific element of magic, but can also be triggered by successfully parrying certain attacks or destroying a specific body part on larger foes.
 * Phase 2: Building the Gauge: Once an enemy is Pressured, the focus shifts to rapidly filling the orange Stagger gauge located beneath their health bar. This is most effectively done by using specific character abilities designed for this purpose, such as Cloud's "Focused Thrust," Tifa's "Focused Strike," or Barret's "Focused Shot".
 * Phase 3: The Stagger Payoff: When the gauge is completely filled, the enemy becomes "Staggered." In this state, they are rendered completely immobile and defenseless for a limited time, and all incoming damage is significantly increased, starting with a 160% bonus. This is the critical window to expend all available ATB bars on the party's most powerful abilities, high-level spells, and Limit Breaks to inflict maximum damage. Tifa Lockhart has a unique and indispensable role in this phase. Her Triangle abilities, when used on a staggered enemy, do not deal significant damage themselves but instead increase the damage percentage multiplier, allowing it to climb well beyond 200% or even 300% with proper execution.
3.3 Materia: The Engine of Customization
The Materia system, inherited from the original game, serves as the primary engine for character customization and strategic depth. It allows players to equip colored orbs into slots on weapons and armor, granting a vast array of spells, abilities, and passive stat boosts. The system is divided into five color-coded categories:
 * Green (Magic): Grants magical spells like Fire, Cure, and Haste.
 * Blue (Support): Provides synergistic effects when linked with other Materia.
 * Yellow (Command): Unlocks new ATB commands like Assess and Steal.
 * Purple (Independent): Offers passive bonuses like increased HP or faster ATB gain.
 * Red (Summon): Allows the summoning of powerful entities in major battles.

Because almost any Materia can be equipped by any character, character roles are not fixed but are defined by their Materia loadout. This encourages players to think strategically about party composition, equipping a variety of elemental spells and support abilities to adapt to the challenges of a given area or boss fight.
The system's deepest strategic layer lies in the Linked Materia Slots found on certain pieces of equipment. Placing a Blue (Support) Materia in a slot that is linked to another allows for powerful combinations. The most critical examples include:
 * Elemental + Magic Materia: When linked on a weapon, this infuses the character's basic attacks with the corresponding element, making it an invaluable tool for applying Pressure. When linked on armor, it provides resistance, immunity, or even absorption of that elemental damage.
 * Magnify + Magic Materia: This combination causes a single-target spell to affect all enemies (for offensive magic) or all allies (for healing magic), albeit with a slight reduction in potency.
3.4 Reconciling Action and Strategy
The combat architecture of Final Fantasy VII Remake offers an elegant solution to a core dilemma in modern JRPG design: how to merge the immediate gratification of action combat with the thoughtful, tactical depth of traditional turn-based systems. The Stagger mechanic is the key to this solution. The real-time action phase is not a mindless exercise in depleting a health bar; it is a strategic "setup" phase. Its purpose is to create the Pressured state, which requires observation, positioning, and the tactical use of ATB to exploit weaknesses—all hallmarks of strategic gameplay. The Staggered phase then serves as the "payoff," a concentrated burst of high-damage attacks that feels functionally equivalent to a powerful, coordinated turn in a classic JRPG. The ATB system acts as the bridge, converting success in the action phase into resources for the strategic phase. In this way, the Stagger mechanic fundamentally recontextualizes real-time action as a means to a strategic end, successfully fusing the two genres.
This design philosophy extends to the very definition of character roles, which are dictated by their function within the Stagger loop. A character's utility is measured by how effectively they contribute to either the setup (Pressure) or the payoff (Stagger). Aerith, with her high magic stat and ability to cast powerful elemental spells from a safe distance, is not just "the mage"; she is the party's premier "Pressure specialist". Tifa is not simply "the monk"; her entire kit is designed to make her the indispensable "Stagger specialist," whose primary role is to maximize the damage multiplier during the brief payoff window. Cloud serves as the versatile core, capable of contributing to both phases with abilities like Focused Thrust (for building the gauge) and Braver (for dealing high stagger damage). This demonstrates a deeply cohesive design where the Materia system, character abilities, and the core combat loop are not independent elements but are all subservient to the central Stagger mechanic, creating a remarkably interconnected and synergistic combat architecture.
IV. Comparative Analysis and Concluding Insights
The combat systems of Sword Art Online, Kingdom Hearts, and Final Fantasy VII Remake, while all falling under the broad umbrella of action JRPGs, are built upon fundamentally different design philosophies. Each offers a unique solution to the challenge of creating engaging real-time combat, shaped by their distinct narrative premises, development legacies, and target player experiences.
4.1 A Tale of Three Philosophies
 * Sword Art Online is defined by its philosophy of narrative simulation. Its primary goal is to translate the concepts of a fictional VRMMORPG into a playable experience. This leads to mechanics like the Risk system in Hollow Fragment or the Chain Burst system in Alicization Lycoris, which serve as tangible analogues for the narrative themes of high-stakes danger and mandatory cooperation. The focus is on making the player feel like they are participating in the world of the anime.
 * Kingdom Hearts follows a philosophy of character-driven spectacle. Its combat evolution is inextricably tied to the growth of its protagonist, Sora. The mechanics are designed to be visually impressive and to empower the player, creating a power fantasy that evolves in step with the narrative. Systems like Drive Forms, Flowmotion, and Keyblade Transformations are all designed to feel spectacular and to constantly provide the player with new and exciting tools.
 * Final Fantasy VII Remake is built on a philosophy of strategic hybridization. Its design is a meticulous and deliberate fusion of real-time action and menu-based strategy. Every mechanic, from the ATB gauge to the Materia system, is subservient to the central Stagger loop, creating a combat system where tactical planning and preparation are just as important as execution. The goal is not just action, but action with clear strategic purpose.
4.2 Player Agency and Skill Expression
These differing philosophies result in distinct definitions of "player skill."
 * In the Sword Art Online games, skill is often expressed through system mastery and tactical coordination. In Hollow Fragment, it is about managing multiple resources (SP, Burst, Risk) and partner commands simultaneously. In Alicization Lycoris, it is about understanding enemy states and executing complex, party-wide Chain Bursts with precision. The customization systems (Skill Trees) allow players to specialize in a role within this coordinated machine.
 * In Kingdom Hearts, skill is primarily expressed through execution and movement. Mastery of the games, especially on higher difficulties, requires a deep understanding of enemy attack patterns, dodge timing, guard points, and combo properties. The series rewards fluid, aggressive, and acrobatic play. The customization systems (Command Decks, Keyblades) provide a wide arsenal of tools to facilitate this expressive, action-oriented style.
 * In Final Fantasy VII Remake, skill is a balance of strategic preparation and tactical execution. A skilled player is one who enters a battle with the correct Materia loadout to exploit enemy weaknesses, effectively manages party-wide ATB and aggro during the fight, and flawlessly executes the Pressure-to-Stagger sequence to maximize damage. The Materia system is the ultimate expression of player agency, allowing for near-total freedom in defining a character's strategic function.
4.3 Comparative Matrix of Core Combat Mechanics
The following table provides a comparative summary of the core mechanics discussed, highlighting the key distinctions between each franchise's approach to combat design.
