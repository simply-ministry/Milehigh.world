"""A data-driven, turn-based RPG prototype.

This script provides a more complex and robust implementation of a text-based
RPG compared to `game.py`. It is designed to be data-driven, loading key
game content such as character stats and item properties from a SQLite
database managed by the `database.py` module.

The core gameplay is turn-based, where the player issues commands to move,
attack, and interact with the game world. The game features a scene management
system, a variety of character and item types, and a simple AI for enemies.

Key Features:
    - **Data-Driven Design**: Integrates with a SQLite database to load game
      content, allowing for easy modification and expansion without changing
      the core game logic.
    - **Turn-Based Gameplay**: The game loop is structured around player and
      enemy turns, providing a classic RPG experience.
    - **Scene Management**: A `SceneManager` class controls the setup,
      execution, and conclusion of different game areas or encounters.
    - **Class-Based Architecture**: Uses a clear and extensible class
      hierarchy for game objects, characters, and items.
